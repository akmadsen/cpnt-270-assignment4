# CPNT 270 - Assignment 4 - A (Mostly) Functioning Website

_Theme:_ Cyberpunk Novelist Website 

The goal of this project is to redo a cyberpunk Author's website, like [William Gibson's](http://williamgibsonbooks.com "William Gibson's Website"), in the style of more modern cyberpunk aesthetic. The primary influence will be [Ruiner](https://www.ruinergame.com "Ruiner Game Website"), but other cyberpunk influences are drawn from as well.
